# Assingment Sql_zoo

It is a project on databases.

SQL_ZOO are quizzes that actually let us build and run queries against existing tables. 

## Thoughts 

First quizzes were not that hard but at the end of the assignment it became really challenging especially self_join part and I had to use some other resources to make my queries to pass. 

Overall I think that this assignment was great and it made me realize how data stored in internet using relational database.
